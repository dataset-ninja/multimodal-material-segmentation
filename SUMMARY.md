**MCubeS: Multimodal Material Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the construction and automotive industries. 

The dataset consists of 2000 images with 25164 labeled objects belonging to 20 different classes including *concrete*, *metal*, *leaf*, and other: *sky*, *wood*, *glass*, *asphalt*, *rubber*, *grass*, *plastic*, *brick*, *ceramic*, *road marking*, *fabric leather*, *human body*, *sand*, *cobblestone*, *plaster*, *water*, and *gravel*.

Images in the MCubeS dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1208 images), *test* (408 images), and *val* (384 images). Additionally, images are grouped by ***im id*** (total 500 images groups). Also every image contains information about its ***scene*** (total 42 scenes). Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2022 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto, Japan</span>.
